# Karan Mannan

I'm a 1st year B.Tech CSE student. 
I like everything with a bit of Python sprinkled on it. 



### Day 1 - 

Started a new Django project, this time to make a project that I hope I'll be proud of. Established the urls and configured the files accordingly, will continue on this project. Following Cody Schafer's Tutorials on YouTube.

Completed some more challenges at picoCTF. Have been learning the basics of reverse engineering and getting comfortable with the linux terminal.
            
### Day 2 -

Continued with Data school tutorials on youtube. Experimented with 'K nearest neighbours classifier' and 'Logistic Regression' using scikit learn. Used the iris dataset for it.
